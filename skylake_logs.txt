    Memory Bound: 82.1% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.

        L1 Bound: 2.4% of Clockticks
        L2 Bound: 0.5% of Clockticks
        L3 Bound: 10.5% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on L3 cache, or contended
         | with a sibling Core. Avoiding cache misses (L2 misses/L3 hits)
         | improves the latency and increases performance.

        DRAM Bound: 70.3% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
         | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
         | performance.
